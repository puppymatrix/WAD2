# wad2_project

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup
cd into frontend folder / backend folder. Run npm install in both folders.

```sh
npm install
```

## For frontend:
To use bootstrap together with Vue, there are some compatibility issues. Use this link: https://bootstrap-vue-next.github.io/bootstrap-vue-next/docs/ for Bootstrap w vue.
### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

## For backend:
We can just ignore this file for now and not do anything in it. Frontend folder should work as expected.
### To start backend server

```sh
npm start
```
